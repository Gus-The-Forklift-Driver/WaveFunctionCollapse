# WaveFunctionCollapse

This is my own implementation of the wave function colapse algorithm.
Because my understanding of this algorithm is limited, the way it works may not be the same as [this] (https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse)
Here is a good python implementation of this algorithm [here] (https://github.com/ikarth/wfc_2019f)
